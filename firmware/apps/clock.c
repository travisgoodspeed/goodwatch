/*! \file clock.c
  \brief Main clock application, that runs by default.
  
  This is the main clock application, which is seen by default
  whenever the watch has nothing else to do.  In addition to telling
  the time, holding a button allows you to see additional
  information, such as the date and git revision.
  
  By default, the time is drawn.  Hold 7 to run a self-test, 8 to
  display the callsign, 9 for the day of the week, / for the date, 4
  for the git tag, 5 for the date of flashing, 6 to toggle the CPU
  load indicator, 0 for the name of the current working channel.
  Hold 1 for the voltage, * for the CPU model number.

  /* So at first glance, this might seem a bit complicated.  Why draw
     the seconds first, and why take so many opportunities to abort
     and return without drawing anything?

     The reason is that the vast majority of CPU time is spent drawing
     the time to the LCD, and that anything we can do to shorten that
     time in each quarter-second frame will increase the watch's
     battery life.  Therefore, we only draw the seconds if they have
     changed, which lets us do nothing on three quarters of the
     frames.  Then we only draw the minutes and hours if the minutes
     have changed, saving two thirds of the digit drawing on each
     frame, and we only draw the tens digit if the ones digit is zero,
     saving us half the LCD memory writes and trable lookups during
     those frames.
     
     This could be further improved by testing hours, but as that only
     applies to one frame in 3600, it won't impact battery life very
     much.  When a button has been pressed or the mode changed, it is
     set non-zero to force the whole frame to be drawn.
     
     int2bcd() works by a ROM table lookup in bcd.o.  The '6147 also
     has a hardware BCD calculator, but as this isn't present in the
     '6137 and only costs us 64 bytes of ROM, it isn't a very high
     priority.
     
     All the digits are drawn out of order for these fancy reasons.
     Sorry about that.
