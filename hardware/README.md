These directories contain different hardware revisions of the
GoodWatch.  When a revision is manufactured, its files are copied to a
new directory and the old may only be updated for documentation
reasons.

The GoodWatch 22 and earlier were designed in Kicad 4, and might be
awkward to open in newer revisions.  The GoodWatch30 is designed in
Kicad 5.

## GoodWatch 30

This is our current design, featuring a new balun and more generous
filters.  Email Travis for some free PCBs if you'd like to build one.


## GoodWatch 20, 21, 22

These designs are outdated, but still supported by software.  They
have a narrower filter at 433MHz than the GoodWatch30, and sharp corners which must be clipped before assembly.

## GoodWatch 10

This was the first GoodWatch, which lacked a radio and had minor
mechanical misalignments.  You probably don't want this one anymore.
